## Summary

While the Exercism track has a specific workflow, I'm a fan of using git any time I work with code.
I had tried the Advent of Code 2020 using Elixir and I struggled in a major way.
While I think the [Elixir Koans](https://github.com/elixirkoans/elixir-koans) are great for beginners, Exercism took solidified my understanding rapidly.
Another great resource is the [DockYard Academy](https://github.com/DockYard-Academy/beta_curriculum) that I also highly recommend.
